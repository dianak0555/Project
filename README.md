Vocal Biomarkers That Differentiate PD Patients from Healthy Individuals

Project Description: 
Parkinson’s disease (PD) affects motor control of the vocal folds, producing measurable acoustic changes in speech. My project investigates whether specific vocal features (including fundamental frequency (Fo), jitter (frequency variation), shimmer (amplitude variation), and harmonics-to-noise ratio (HNR)) differ between healthy individuals and those diagnosed with PD. 
I hypothesize that compared to healthy individuals, PD patients will exhibit lower Fo, higher jitter and shimmer, and lower HNR. To test this hypothesis, I perform data analysis, transformations to address non-normal data, assumption testing, and non-parametric group comparisons using Wilcoxon rank-sum tests. Histograms, QQ-plots, violin plots, and boxplots visualize the dataset distribution and findings. These analyses evaluate whether vocal instability can serve as a potential low-cost biomarker for PD detection.

Data Description: 
The dataset used in this project contains 195 voice recordings from 31 individuals, including 23 with Parkinson’s disease. Each row represents one voice recording, and each column corresponds to a quantified acoustic feature. The dataset includes measures of pitch, frequency variation, amplitude variation, voice quality, and nonlinear dynamical markers often used in speech-based pathology studies. These voice samples were originally collected for biomedical research on dysphonia and PD progression. The dataset was obtained from Kaggle. For this project, only the variables MDVP.Fo.Hz. (fundamental frequency), MDVP.Jitter… (jitter), MDVP.Shimmer.dB. (Shimmer), HNR (harmonics-to-noise ratio), and status (1 for PD or 0 for Healthy) were used.
